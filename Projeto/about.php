					Shadowrun is a science fantasy tabletop role-playing game set in a near-future fictional universe in which cybernetics, 
					magic and fantasy creatures co-exist. 
					It combines genres of cyberpunk, urban fantasy and crime, 
					with occasional elements of conspiracy, horror and detective fiction. 
					From its inception in 1989, Shadowrun has remained among the most popular role-playing games.
					It has spawned a vast franchise that includes a series of novels, a collectible card game,
					two miniature-based tabletop wargames, and multiple video games.
